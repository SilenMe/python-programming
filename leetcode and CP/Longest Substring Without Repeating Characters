Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
Example 4:

Input: s = ""
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.





s='pwwkew'
i=0
j=0
c=[]
j=0
k=len(s)
for m in range(k):
  i=m
  j=m+1
  
  while(i<k and j<k):
    if(s[i]==s[j]):
      c.append(j-i)
      z=1
      i=j
    j+=1

if len(c)==0:
  c.append(j-i)

print(max(c))
